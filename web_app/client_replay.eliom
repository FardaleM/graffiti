  (* It is a simple copy of code...
     It need to be recorded, 'modulariser' and 'generiser'

     Some issue list:
       - Canvas are place as main service to let space for color palette.
         But there is not color palette.
       - About button it is not working (?)
         It is realy needed ?
         Because of code which handle that which it not launch (menu)
         But it is handle also save button, not needed here ?
         Not from sever, but from canvas
