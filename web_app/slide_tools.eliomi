[%%client.start]

type orientation = Left | Right | Up | Down
type mode = Offset | Width_height

(** [slide target ?elm orientation ?mode
    ?allow_click ?move_sensibility
     ?start ?move ?end min max]

    [target] is the target element of event
    [elm] is the element to transform, by default it is [target]
    [allow_click] if it is by defaut at true:
       allow to expand or contract when a simple click is fired
    [move_margin] allow to look a little move at a click, default at 0(px)
       If you already ignore click with [allow_click] at false
       and if you take [move_margin] at 1(px) (for example),
       move action which move less or egal at 1px will be ignored

    [move] take current move value in parameter
    [end] take final value in parameter

    [min] is min value
    [max] is max value

    Default mode is Lg_offset

    Lg_offset mode take information from offsetLeft/Top property
    (A calcul is made for right and down position)
    and set on style.left/right/top/button

    Lg_width_height mode take information from clientWidth/Height property
    and set on style.width/height
    Obviously with this mode, oritention left/right - up/down do the same thing
